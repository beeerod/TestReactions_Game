# TestReactions_Game

This here is a game project that I created in order to get familar with Javascript.

The web game is very simple, but I also think it's very cool and it's actually fun to try out.

The game is a way for you to test your reactions, by testing how fast you are able to click on the various shapes popping up

one at a time on the screen.
